# My first tests with testcafe

This project aims to help you starting with browsing testing tool testcafe (https://testcafe.io/)

This project contains following content:
- A how-to for installation and configuration
- A first basic test to explain how testcafe works
- a guide to fill a form with testcafe ?
- a more complex test with login then adding a product to a cart

I try to explain my design choices to help you doing better quality code.

You surely understand, but with testcafe, you need to code :)

Indeed, testcafe is a nodeJS package so you will need to learn: javascript and/or typescript.

## Prerequisites

You need to install NodeJS  (https://nodejs.org/): I use version 16

I also use **yarn** as a package manager instead of **npm**

Installation of yarn:
```bash
npm install -g yarn
```
